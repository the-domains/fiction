There's a red barn, back where I used to live, that's full of wolves.

They're not mistreated. They're fed twice a day -- chicken, mostly -- and they can wander around a little pen if they want fresh air.

In the morning, before the sun rises, a farmer and his wife come to milk the mother wolves, so they don't get engorged.

But the wolves still howl at night.

They howl because they're not allowed to run, wild, roughshod across the countryside.

That land belongs to the sheep now ... and they're never going back.
